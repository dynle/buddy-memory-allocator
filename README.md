Buddy memory allocator is a memory allocation algorithm that divides memory into partitions to try to satisfy a memory request as suitably as as possible.

<br>
This program allows 64 blocks to be allocated and deallocated, and it correctly merges freed blocks. Each time the program splits a block, it adds a ’|’ to show where the split happened. ’-’ represents free blocks, and ’#’ represents in-use blocks. The two numbers printed out as in 0/4 represent the beginning address and number of blocks in a chunk. The program takes three one-letter commands: ’a’ for allocate, ’f’ for free, and ’q’ for quit. The second argument on a line is the number of blocks (for allocate) or the address, or first block number, of the allocated chunk (for free).

## Run

Use Python to run buddy-memory-allocator.py.

```bash
python buddy-memory-allocator.py
```

## Usage

```bash
# 'a' for allocation / numebr of blocks
a 4

# 'f' foor free / the beginning address
f 0

# 'q' for quit
q
```
